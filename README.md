# Data Visualization Projects 🖥️📊

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I showcase a series of mini data visualization projects. Each project is based on a well-known dataset, and the goal is to explore, analyze, and visualize data in creative and meaningful ways.

## 1. 🐧 Palmer Penguins Dataset Analysis

**Project Description:**  
The Palmer Penguins dataset is a great alternative to the classic Iris dataset for practicing data visualization and statistical analysis. It contains data about three penguin species—_Adelie_, _Gentoo_, and _Chinstrap_—collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. My analysis will focus on basic statistical information, species-specific analysis, sex-based comparisons, relationships between variables and island specific insights.
